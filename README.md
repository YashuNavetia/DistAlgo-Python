In this course project we have implemented client-server model for chain replication algorithm for high availability and fault-tolerence. It is implemented in two different languages: 1. DistAlgo 2. JaVA

Various files and commands:

Project_Description:- 1.project.txt

Code Folders:- 1. distAlgo: chain_rep_distalgo 2. Java : Pending...

Config Files: 1. config.json in respective folders 2. bootstrap.sh in nodejs consists of code to start clients and servers

Test cases : config_phase2, config_phase3

Prerequisites:- 1. DistAlgo: You need to have the distribution installed on your system and added in the $PATH variable. or downolad "da" folder and run file from same directory. 

Code Execution:- 1. distAlgo: python3 -m da client-serever.da config1

Currently reading test cases from /config-phase3 folder based on the mapping file "config.ini"
so just pass "config1" as command line argument for executing 1st test case and so on..
